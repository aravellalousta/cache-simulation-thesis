# Cache Simulation Thesis

This repository contains a project developed as part of my bachelor thesis in Applied Informatics - Computer Science at the University of Macedonia. This simulation aims to illustrate the functioning of three distinct cache memory architectures: direct-mapped, fully associative with LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy, and set-associative with LRU. 


## Bachelor Thesis Context
As a student in the Applied Informatics - Computer Science program, this project serves as a practical exploration of theoretical concepts learned throughout my academic journey. The thesis focuses on cache memory, a critical component in computer architecture, and aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how different cache architectures function and their implications on overall system performance.


## Features
- Graphical User Interface: Explore cache simulations through an intuitive GUI.
- Direct-Mapped Cache: Simulates a direct-mapped cache and its impact on memory access times.
- Fully Associative Cache with LRU: Demonstrates a fully associative cache with the Least Recently Used replacement policy.
- Set Associative Cache with LRU: Simulates a set-associative cache with LRU replacement policy
